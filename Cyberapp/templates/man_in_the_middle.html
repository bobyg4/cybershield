        <h2 style="color: black;">Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2>
        <p style="color: black;">
            A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack occurs when a malicious actor intercepts communication between two parties without their knowledge.
            This type of attack can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the communication.
            In a typical MitM attack scenario, the attacker positions themselves between the sender and receiver, capturing and possibly modifying the transmitted data.
            MitM attacks can target various communication channels, including email, instant messaging, web browsing, and voice calls.
            The goal of the attacker may be to eavesdrop on sensitive information, manipulate data, or impersonate one of the parties involved.
            MitM attacks are particularly concerning in public Wi-Fi networks, where data transmissions are often unencrypted and vulnerable to interception.

        <h2 style="color: black;">Preventing MitM Attacks</h2>
        <p style="color: black;">
            There are several measures organizations and individuals can take to mitigate the risk of MitM attacks: <br>
                Use encrypted communication protocols such as HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and SSH to secure data transmission.<br>
                Avoid connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks, especially when transmitting sensitive information.<br>
                Regularly update software and operating systems to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.<br>
                Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), to prevent unauthorized access to accounts.<br>
                Educate users about the risks of MitM attacks and encourage them to exercise caution when sharing sensitive information online.<br>
            
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: black;">Detecting MitM Attacks</h2>
        <p style="color: black;">
            Detecting MitM attacks can be challenging due to their covert nature, but organizations can employ the following strategies:
            <ul style="color: black;">
                <li>Monitor network traffic for anomalies, such as unexpected redirections or unauthorized access attempts.</li>
                <li>Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to identify and block suspicious activity.</li>
                <li>Use network segmentation to isolate sensitive systems and limit the impact of potential MitM attacks.</li>
                <li>Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
