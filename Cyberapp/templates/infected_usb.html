    <h2 style="color: black;">Infected USB Drives - Risks and Prevention</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">
        Infected USB drives pose significant risks to computer systems and networks by spreading malware and other malicious software.
        USB drives, also known as thumb drives or flash drives, are portable storage devices that can be easily connected to computers for data transfer and storage.
        However, they can also serve as vehicles for malware transmission if infected with malicious code.
        Malicious actors may distribute infected USB drives through social engineering tactics, such as leaving them in public places or sending them as gifts.
        Once inserted into a computer, infected USB drives can execute malware payloads, compromise system security, and facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive data.

    <h2 style="color: black;">Common Risks of Infected USB Drives</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">
        Infected USB drives can pose various risks to computer systems and networks, including:
        <ul style="color: black;">
            <li><b>Malware Distribution:</b> Infected USB drives can spread malware infections, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware, to connected computers.</li>
            <li><b>System Compromise:</b> Malicious code executed from infected USB drives can compromise system security, steal sensitive information, and disrupt normal operations.</li>
            <li><b>Network Vulnerabilities:</b> Infected USB drives connected to networked computers can introduce vulnerabilities and serve as entry points for attackers to infiltrate network environments.</li>
            <li><b>Data Loss:</b> Malware infections from infected USB drives can lead to data loss, corruption, or encryption, resulting in permanent damage to stored files and documents.</li>
            <li><b>Financial Loss:</b> Infected USB drives may cause financial losses for organizations through downtime, data recovery costs, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2 style="color: black;">Preventing Infected USB Drive Attacks</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">
        To prevent infected USB drive attacks and mitigate associated risks, users and organizations should implement the following security measures:
        <ul style="color: black;">
            <li><b>Use Trusted Sources:</b> Only use USB drives obtained from trusted sources and avoid connecting unknown or unverified devices to your computer.</li>
            <li><b>Scan USB Drives:</b> Use antivirus or antimalware software to scan USB drives for malware before opening or accessing files stored on them.</li>
            <li><b>Enable Auto-Scan:</b> Configure antivirus software to automatically scan USB drives when they are inserted into your computer to detect and remove any potential threats.</li>
            <li><b>Update Software:</b> Keep your operating system, antivirus software, and security patches up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities exploited by malware.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Safe Handling:</b> Avoid sharing USB drives with others, and do not insert unknown USB drives into your computer without scanning them for malware first.</li>
            <li><b>Educate Users:</b> Educate users about the risks of infected USB drives and the importance of practicing safe USB drive handling and data security protocols.</li>
        </ul>
