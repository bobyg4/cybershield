    <h2 style="color: black;">DDOS - DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">
        A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is like a crowd of people overwhelming a store's entrance during a sale, making it impossible for customers to enter. 
        In computing, it means a hacker floods your website with fake traffic, causing it to crash or become unavailable.
        DDoS attacks are launched through botnets from multiple computers in various locations, using up bandwidth and making the system unavailable.
        The reasons behind these attacks could be blackmail, revenge, extortion, vandalism, or hacktivism.
        These attacks not only disrupt your services but also damage your reputation and revenue.
        Organizations of all sizes are vulnerable to DDoS attacks, and they can occur at any time without warning.

    <h2 style="color: black;">Not all DDoS attacks are malicious</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">
        Sometimes, your website or blog might unintentionally attract a surge in legitimate users, causing your web application to become overwhelmed.
        This issue typically affects small and medium-size online stores during peak shopping periods like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.
        However, distinguishing between legitimate traffic and malicious attacks can be challenging.
        It is essential to have robust monitoring systems in place to detect and mitigate any unexpected spikes in traffic.
        Additionally, proactive planning and scalability measures can help minimize the impact of sudden surges in visitors.

    <h2 style="color: black;">How to tell if youâ€™re a victim of DoS</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">
        If your website suddenly becomes slow or displays a 'service unavailable' message, you might be dealing with a DDoS attack.
        Since these attacks are often distributed across multiple locations and IP addresses, blocking individual sources may not be effective.
        Instead, it is crucial to monitor your network traffic for abnormal patterns and seek assistance from your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or DDoS mitigation service.
        Prompt action is essential to minimize downtime and restore normal operations.
