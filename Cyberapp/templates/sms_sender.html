    <h2 style="color: black;">SMS Sender Attacks - Risks and Prevention</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">
        SMS sender attacks, also known as SMS spoofing or SMS phishing, involve the manipulation of SMS messages to deceive recipients and perform malicious actions.
        Attackers can spoof sender information to make SMS messages appear as if they are sent from a trusted source or organization, such as a bank, government agency, or legitimate business.
        SMS sender attacks can be used for various malicious purposes, including phishing scams, account takeover attempts, identity theft, and spreading malware.
        While SMS sender attacks may seem less sophisticated than other cyber threats, they can still pose significant risks to individuals and organizations, particularly those that rely on SMS for communication and authentication.
