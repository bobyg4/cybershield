    <h2 style="color: black;">Adware - Unwanted Advertising Software</h2>
    <p style="color: black;">
        Adware is a type of unwanted software designed to display advertisements on a user's computer or mobile device without their consent.
        It often comes bundled with other software downloads or installed through deceptive means, such as misleading pop-up ads or fake software updates.
        Adware can manifest in various forms, including pop-up ads, banners, browser redirects, and sponsored search results.
        While not inherently malicious, adware can be intrusive, disruptive, and diminish the user experience.
        It may also compromise privacy by collecting user data and browsing habits to deliver targeted advertisements.

            <li><b>Browser Modifications:</b> Adware may modify browser settings, such as the default homepage, search engine, or new tab page, to redirect users to sponsored websites.</li>
            <li><b>Slowing Down System:</b> Some adware consumes system resources and slows down the device's performance, leading to sluggishness or crashes.</li>
            <li><b>Data Collection:</b> Adware may collect user data, such as browsing history, search queries, IP addresses, and geolocation, to deliver targeted advertisements.</li>
            <li><b>Installation Without Consent:</b> Adware often installs without the user's explicit consent, hidden within freeware or shareware bundles or disguised as legitimate software updates.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
